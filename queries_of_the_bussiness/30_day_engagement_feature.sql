-- (Q2) 30-day engagement features (sessions, events, days active, push open rate)
-- Goal: Build behavioral signals for churn/retention models.
-- sessions_30d, active_days_30d, events_30d, push_open_rate_30d â†’ strong churn predictors.
-- Use as continuous features; optionally bucketize (low/med/high engagement).
